I woke up around 9 o'clock feeling low-spirited from having to be away for the next couple of months. I let my mind wander for at least an hour before I got up. There's a lot to think about: the future, law school, my scholarship, work prospects, politics, money, money, money - *enfim* - all the things I need to get done before getting back to my husband. I love my country and my family, but that doesn't make it easy. 

Suddenly, there was some scratching on the door from Lucky, who wished to give me his good mornings: I missed petting that little one! After some cuddling, I went to the kitchen to have my morning espresso and say hi to my mom, who was expecting me with a smile. Following breakfast, I decided to try to set up my git repo on my computer so that I could blog sometime during today (if you're seeing this, then it worked).  

While I was in Sweden, I asked my grandparents if they could wait until Sunday to celebrate grandpa's 76th birthday, so today was the day. We gathered at my grandparents' home around midday to help with the food and setting things up. Everyone came to the door to greet me and give me a tight hug and some kisses, Portuguese-style.

The food was delicious and the wine was fine, but the company was the best part. Even though I'm still not feeling all that good, joking with my family and telling them about my wonderful time in Sweden really lifted my mood. I'll never get tired of our inappropriate jokes. 

We finished our meal with chocolate birthday cake, almond pie, passion fruit mousse and a port wine from 1964. The port was wonderfully kept and aged gracefully, body and all. My grandpa's friend, a dentist called Serôdio, told us some stories about his time in Africa during the 60's. We don't always share the same views in politics, but he has the sobriety of very few men. Overall, we had a great time.

After lunch, my uncle and I went to the mall to have coffee. It was noisy and not all that private, but we still managed to have a really interesting conversation about European politics and its polarization. The elections in Sweden worry me, not because of the possibility of SD grabbing 20% of the votes (unlike most of the media, I don't think that they are an extreme right-wing party currently), but because that is a symptom of the decay of Sweden's national identity and culture, which isn't something that goes unnoticed by its citizens. Sweden doesn't need an aggressive, quasi-predatory national pride, but it needs to be (at least) okay to recognize that it has a unique culture that deserves to be preserved and respected, instead of constantly dismissed as inferior or even non-existent. By my reckoning, that is a right of any citizen of any nation. But this isn't, or wasn't, a political post: there will be a section for that someday.

After the coffee and some shopping, we went to my parents' place to sit and talk a bit about wine and life. I was too full to even attempt dinner, but the family will gather again tomorrow to handle the leftovers because we take no prisoners. 

I will end the day by talking to my Querido, which is the best way to end any day, at least until I'm not back home. Soon, though...
