We got up a little later than usual, since making and eating last night's rhubarb pie kept us up until the first hour of the day. The morning was spent relaxing. 

It's Tor's day, which means that the MakerSpace Lidköping guys hold their weekly meeting. However, this week we did something a little different: we went to Rackeby - Zira's home - to pick cherries. The cherries will be used to make saft in concentrated form, which we will make ourselves, bottle, and sell at the town square. 

Zira's place has a beauty of its own and, at times, looks like something out of a fantasy movie. But we had work to do, so we collected a couple of buckets, walked for a few minutes, and started picking cherries. Luckily for me - and because I don't exactly have the sky-reaching height of the average Swedish man -, plenty of them were in the lower parts of the trees, so I had no problem picking them. Once those were gone, Querido held down some branches so that I could reach the other cherries.

We listened to Paredes and joked around most of the time. We also listened to some music on Phil's portable phonograph. I took the chance to eat some of the cherries I picked, of course - they were very tasty! It must be hard for someone who does this professionally to not fill their mouths with dozens of tiny red cherries every hour. 

When we were done, a total of three big buckets were filled. It took us some four hours to pick everything and it was a bit tiring, but also relaxing and mind-repairing... the smells and sounds of the countryside have that effect on me. 

Querido and I will be back at Rackeby during tomorrow for Liemannen's rehearsal.
