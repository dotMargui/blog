It's been a surprisingly warm Summer here in Sweden, to the point where one has a hard time falling asleep without the AC on. Even though I'm Portuguese and, therefore, more than used to excessive heat, it's still something I don't tolerate very well. Our only plan for the day was to attend MakerSpace, so we decided to just cuddle and spend time together, which, to be fair, is my favorite thing to do.  After my usual morning coffee and some fil, Querido played Civ and I went back to the introductory CSS course. 

A little past lunchtime, Phil called and invited us to go to the beach and discuss MakerSpace-related stuff. To be honest, I was too lazy to move and leave my (newly-found) comfortable position in bed at first, and we only had ten minutes to get ready. But, besides the fact that I like spending time with the boys, it was still very warm, and I always say that the beach is the best place to be during an unbearably warm day. 

We went to Skogshyddan, by the Vänern. I had never been there before and it always baffles me how dynamic Sweden is: it's full of different environments and vibes at a walking distance. We walked a bit and then decided to lay down in a quiet place. Of course, that quiet place was also full of very annoying flies, so we had to get up, move slightly, and try again. We found a really good spot a bit closer to the water.

I really enjoyed sunbathing: it was needed and very relaxing! It was good to be silent for a while and appreciate the place we were at. The heat was much more tolerable at the beach and the sun was actually very kind on the skin. Querido and I decided to try the water out and wet our feet, and I thought it was warm and nice in comparison to what I'm used to (freezing-cold Atlantic waters). The boys thought it was a bit too cold, but if it wasn't for the fact that we had other places to go to, I would've loved to swim a little. That place is beautiful! I want to visit again.

After the beach, we went to a plant store nearby to buy a succulent. We ended up getting a Danish *Tacitus bellus* and decided to keep its name, Tacitus, after the Roman historian who wrote *Germania*. (If you're interested in the laws and customs of the different Germanic tribes outside of the Empire, I highly recommend reading that book.)

After that, we went to the place in town where you can still eat old-school Toscakaka, but we were out of luck, so we just drove to MakerSpace. The meeting went well, but there was a lot of noise from the car fans in town. 

After MakerSpace, my husband and I went shopping for dinner. We ended the day with a "risotto" made of oats and pork chops. It may sound like an unlikely meal, but it was delicious!
