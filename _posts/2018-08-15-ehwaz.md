Warning: this short post's sole purpose is to celebrate love, Swedish food, and Västerbottenost. So if you don't like cheesy things in general, this might be too much for you. I have no story to tell, to be fair - not even for memory-keeping purposes; it's not a dinner I'll forget anyway. 

My Querido. My husband. I love that man. Nothing makes me as happy as he does, and I'm thankful for every moment we spend together: that's my first thought every morning when I wake up next to him. It truly is a liberating bond. Cooking (or baking) together, sitting down to talk and have some Portuguese wine, and other simple, mundane things have become my favorite things. That's what today was all about. I could go on, but he already knows all the other things I could write, and everyone else only needs to know what I've already written. 

We went shopping and then back to my svärföräldrars place to cook something nice together: today's dinner was Västerbottenostpaj made from scratch. There will be a recipe on either this blog or Querido's, but whatever recipe you decide to follow, just make sure you're sipping some Vinho do Porto while you're cooking. For this one, we recommend Sandeman. Swedish and Portuguese things go very well together. It worked wonderfully for us. And the pie!

Västerbottenost has become one of my favorite cheeses ever since I tried it. It's extremely underrated. It has a strong, nutty taste with both salty and sweet notes, and a fun flaky/crumbly texture. And it's so good in pies... 

A good complement for Västerbottenostpaj is seafood, so we also made some Portuguese-style spicy shrimp again. There will definitely be a recipe for that, for it is one of humanities best-kept secrets, at least for now (much like Västerbotten cheese). After dinner, we had otherworldly paltkoma: we ate the whole pie, except for a small slice. If you have problems falling asleep, I recommend Swedish food. 

Bzzzz, time flies and this post is already over. See, I warned you that I had no story to tell. I guess you'll just have to be happy for me. That's it for today!
