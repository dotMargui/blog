We got up pretty late. We talked to Zira in the car for a while, which meant only getting under our door's horseshoe around five in the morning. Still, we started the day with some müsli and fil - we decided to keep it light since we would be meeting friends for dinner later.

A bit before 18:00, Zira and Tomas (Z's father) picked us up and drove us to Mellbygatans, where we met Toby, Simon, and Justine. In a way, it reminded me of New Year's Eve: we all love our caustic jokes and teasing - which is a good sign, since you can only say horrible things to people you like and trust. Also, because I'm Portuguese, Justine is French, and everyone else there was a Swede, there were some interesting non-vile cultural exchanges.  Either way, France invaded Portugal three times and failed. I'm just saying. Now you know. 

We started off by drinking some beer and skipped the actual starters. As for the main course, everyone had a burger except me: I ordered breaded perch with färskpotatis, beans, capers, lemon, dill, and gräddfil instead. Not because I'm fancy, but because I take every chance I get to try a new fish recipe. 

After everyone was done with the main course, we had butter-fried sourdough, Swedish cheeses, and prosciutto. The bread was godly.

What about dessert? Fucking Hell.

After dinner, we went to Toby's place and tried some French cognac in the garden, where we were joined by a hedgehog. The hedgehog was much nicer than the neighbor who said "O, no hablo español" after Querido told him I was Portuguese. 

A few minutes after Simon and Justine left, it started to rain, so the remaining four of us (excluding the hedgehog) went inside for a beer and some music. Toby and I have similar taste when it comes to stoner metal and its related genres, which is very cool! On the day I first met him, he drove us to Skövde and we listened to Bongzilla and Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats the whole time. 

Anyway, around 22:00, Tomas was back to drive us home. It was still raining, so that ride was a life-saver. Tomas is very kind. 

That's it for today! It was great to meet everyone again after not having seen Toby and Simon for about seven months, and it was also great to get to know Justine. Good times!
